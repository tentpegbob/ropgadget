# ROPgadget

This is a Python script with imports module's from Jonathan Salwan's ROPgadget tool located at https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget. As such, it's actually a dependency that must be install via pip install ropgadget or pip3 install ropgadget. Otherwise this script won't be very valuable at all.
